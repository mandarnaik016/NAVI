\noindent \textbf{1. ABSTRACT}

\noindent According to WHO, India has 12 million visually impaired due to uncorrected refractive error.

\noindent Several visually impaired people belong to the underprivileged background and live in villages and tier 4 cities where they don't have access to spectacles, but they are unaware this is correctable. 

\noindent Navigator for Visually Impaired People refers to systems that can assist or guide people with vision loss, ranging from partially sighted to the blind, utilizing sound commands.

\noindent Creating a fusion of sensing technology and voice-based guidance system, products can be developed which could give better results than individual technology. The proposed system will be suitable to reduce collision risks by enabling an impaired person to walk outdoors easily. 

\noindent The suggested result includes a camera vision system to make an independent operation for out-of-door navigation using the Internet of things and create a good user experience to blind peoples.\eject 

\noindent \textbf{2. INTRODUCTION}

\noindent Recent studies on global health estimate that 217 million people suffer from visual impairment, and 36 million from blindness. It has affected their freedom threatened in terms of many everyday tasks, with the focus being placed on those that involve moving through a strange environment.

\noindent In this regard, a navigation system's purpose is to provide users with required and/or helpful data to get to a destination point. As we will see, researchers working in this field have yet to find effective, efficient, safe, and cost-effective technical solutions for both the outdoor and indoor guidance needs of blind and visually impaired people.

\noindent This navigation system is designed for helping blind people to navigate around safely. User does not need to move the white cane around to detect obstacle like they do with the normal cane. Therefore a user can easily walk with a white cane and continuously get information about obstacles around with the help of sensors and IoT. 

\noindent Much research is being conducted on building a navigation system for visually impaired people. Several researchers address this challenge in indoor and outdoor environments. However, most of these approaches have limitations since this challenge involves many issues (e.g., accuracy, and coverage).\eject

\noindent \textbf{4.1 Algorithm \& Framework}

\noindent \includegraphics*[width=2.93in, height=1.55in, keepaspectratio=false]{image2.bmp}

\noindent The YOLO framework (You Only Look Once)  deals with object detection differently. It takes the entire image in a single instance and predicts the bounding box coordinates and class probabilities for these boxes. The biggest advantage of using YOLO is its superb speed -- it's incredibly fast and can process 45 frames per second. YOLO also understands generalized object representation.

\noindent The YOLO algorithm is important because of the following reasons:

\noindent \begin{enumerate}
\item 1. .\underbar{Speed}: This algorithm improves the speed of detection because it can predict objects in real time.

\noindent \item 2. .\underbar{High accuracy}: YOLO is a predictive technique that provides accurate results with minimal background errors.

\noindent \item 3. .\underbar{Learning capabilities}: The algorithm has excellent learning capabilities that enable it to learn the representations of objects and apply them in object detection.

\noindent \textbf{5. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR NEXT SEMESTER}

\noindent Once we are done with the simulation part, we will shift to implementing the actual prototype of it. In this process, we will try to make the project affordable so that the project becomes cost-effective and budget friendly. Also, we may contact a visually impaired person to know his/her needs and requirements.

\noindent Every time we will try to implement it in the real environment to get the ideal output. After implementation, with the help of a visually impaired person, we can test it in actual surroundings and can go through their problems, and can improve the system simultaneously.

\noindent \textbf{6. CONCLUSION}

\noindent Visually impaired people faced many problems in their daily life, and while traveling they always depend on any person or guide dog. Blind Stick is very helpful for them but Stick has certain restrictions. We created a navigation device for visually impaired people so that they can perform their daily tasks.

\noindent There are certain Devices already available in the market but they cannot solve the actual problem. Our project is an integrated system of those devices.

\noindent In this paper, We present wearable Accessories in the form of Smart Glasses and Smart Shoes for visually impaired people to deal with their Tasks. Smart Glasses Capture images in front of those objects and recognize them and convert it into an audio form which is then sent to the earphones.

\noindent Once, a person goes close to that object Smart Shoes Gives output in the form of a vibration motor so that the person avoids those objects. So, with the help of this project person can easily detect and avoid an obstacle, and also simply communicate with the environment.\eject 

\noindent \textbf{6. CONCLUSION}

\noindent \textbf{6.1 ADVANTAGES}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{ }Both indoor and outdoor navigation are possible with the device.

\item  Detects obstacles and notifies the blind person through vibration and speech production.

\item  The devices placed are comfortable and easy to handle. 

\item  Cheap, light-weight constructions available, effectively informs of obstacles at ground-level.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent 

\noindent \textbf{6.2 LIMITATIONS}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{ }Does not protect from obstacles at the torso.

\item  The system is capable of identifying obstacles at reasonable distances and speeds; however, it is suggested that if an automated navigation system can be combined with a white cane, one can have a safe and reliable mobility aid.

\item  It needs many components that make the system complex and expensive.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent \textbf{}

\noindent \textbf{6.3 FUTURE SCOPE}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{ }This project can be extended by incorporating a GPS module.

\item  We can interface this module to send messages to near and dear once of the blind person regarding his/her current position.

\item  During so, we can track the moment of the blind person in a very efficient manner.

\item  The future work can be performance of the stick can be improved by adding health monitoring features.

\item  The proposed system must work on Wide Area Network and visually impaired people must be able to travel anywhere without restricting the areas.
