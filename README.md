# NAVI

A device called as Navigator For Visually Impaired Person (NAVI) uses auditory commands to aid or direct people who
are blind or have vision loss, ranging from partial sight. The
proposed system will be suitable for reducing collision risks by
enabling an impaired person to walk outdoors easily.
